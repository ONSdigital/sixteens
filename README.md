# sixteens

A tile design friendly pattern library starter kit with a simple responsive grid inspired by BBS’c igel consisting of 16px columns. 

This base implimentation has three simple break points.

- Desktops get 59 x 16px columns
- Portrait tablets get 47 x 16px columns
- Mobiles and browsers that don’t support media queries get 100% wide columns

The grid can be re-configured to your requirements - eg 60 column grid instead of 59 etc...
